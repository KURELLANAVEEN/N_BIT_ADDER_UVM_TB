# N_BIT_ADDER_UVM_TB

Hi,

This repo is all about UVM Test Bench for verifying `n-bit adder`.

This project is for complete beginners who want to understand the flow of a UVM testbench. In each testbench file, I have added comments for important lines. The main goal is to understand how communication happens between UVM components so that you can verify the actual design.

Feel free to add your comments for any improvements or if you find any incorrect code.
